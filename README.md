# GrowSoft
# Programming Language : Arduino

An arduino oriented source code for a project, which allows the automated control of a GreenHouse. In particular, this project allows the user to set the desired conditions ( temperature,humidity,soil humidity) in the greenhouse through an lcd and some buttons. The program wholy controls the conditions of the greenhouse (getting condition data from dht sensors) by switching on/of the adjusted radiator, dehumidifier and automatic watering. Also anytime the user can spectate the current conditions of the greenhouse and observe which adjusted systems are on.
Of course this is only the code of the project.
